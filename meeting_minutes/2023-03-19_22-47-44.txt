The team reviewed the backlog items, which included developing a new user registration feature, implementing a payment gateway, and designing a new user dashboard. Ramsha provided an update on the backlog items and estimated that it could take around six to ten days to complete all the items.

Jaffer suggested that they prioritize the user registration feature, as it is a crucial aspect of the product and can be delivered in four to five days. Ramsha agreed with Jaffer's assessment, and they decided to prioritize the user registration feature.
