Sarah: Alright, everyone. Let's get started with the sprint planning meeting. John, do you have the backlog ready?

John: Yes, I do. So for this sprint, we have three items that we need to work on. The first one is the user authentication feature, the second one is the dashboard redesign, and the third one is the integration with the payment gateway.

Mike: Sounds good. Do we have any more details on these items?

John: Yes, for the user authentication feature, we need to implement two-factor authentication and add a forgot password functionality. For the dashboard redesign, we want to make it more user-friendly and add a few more widgets. And for the payment gateway integration, we need to integrate with Stripe and test it thoroughly.

Lisa: Okay, got it. Do we have any dependencies on any other team for these items?

John: No, we don't. We have everything we need to complete these tasks within our team.

Sarah: Great. So, let's estimate the effort for these tasks. Mike, let's start with the user authentication feature. What's your estimate?

Mike: I think it will take me around 5 days to complete.

Sarah: Okay. Lisa, what's your estimate?

Lisa: I'm thinking around 4 days.

Sarah: Jane, what about you?

Jane: I agree with Lisa. I think 4 days is a good estimate.

Sarah: Okay. Let's go with 4 days then. Now, let's move on to the dashboard redesign. Lisa, what's your estimate?

Lisa: I think it will take me around 3 days.

Sarah: Jane, what's your estimate?
